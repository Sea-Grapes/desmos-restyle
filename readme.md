# Desmos Restyle

A simple userscript to make the Desmos scientific calculator wider than usual. I sometimes do my scratch work in here, but it often gets cut off when the equations get long.

# Installation

If you want to use the userscript version, install [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or something similar, then copy the script into a new page.
